Recline on the beach and watch hot air balloon float by. also there's an anime girl.

This is a PCVR OpenXR game using the Godot 4.2 game engine, made for the [Godot XR Game Jam July 2024](https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-july-2024).

The code quality is typical of a game jam, i.e. very bad. Use as a negative example for how to structure maintainable godot 4 games. 

This is based off of https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-template/ , and still has most of the placeholder stuff in there; Was too lazy to strip it out.
